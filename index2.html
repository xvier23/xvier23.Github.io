<h2>My Hobbies</h2>
<p>I like playing video games, basketball and adapting to new cultures</p>

<h2>Learnings</h2>
<p>On paper I learnt python, bublesort, float, parts of error handling, calling fuctions with main, using matplotlib, and other features. The more I learn , the more I realise how ignorant I am, I realise that over-relying on teachers is not a good thing. Therefore learning from the internet seems like a good option.I search my problems on the interent, and i look down the forums and surf through the blogs just to solve the problems that I encountered.</p>
<p>I believe that school is the demo of society, other than the knowledge that we learnt from the books, there are some hidden principles that we experienced by ourself.</p>
<p>I am certan that im 100% not a quiet student, and im sure that im one of the most energetic kid on class, there for i get to learn more about socialising. I learnt the importance of working as a team, I know that this is lame, but trust me, this is the first time that i realize how important that a teammates are.</p>


<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>I belive that I still have a huge room for improvement</p>
<p>I can work harder on both IT and Business, I rely so much on the internet which is one of my weakness, and I should be more attentive on the questions and the things around me.Therefore I plan of using my summer holiday wisely. Im planning to selfstudy more about python and the apply of different fucntions, or maybe to consolidate my foundations on this language.</p>
